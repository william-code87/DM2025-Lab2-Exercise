\napproaches. For a story about withdrawing from the world and becoming emotionally bottled up, \nthe flower-as-metaphor title is perhaps the most on-the-nose thing about Ronan Day-Lewis’ \nfeature debut. Anemone is co-written with and starring his father Daniel in his first on-screen \nappearance since 2017’s Phantom Thread. It is sad, absurdist, brooding, tender and intense. What \nwere you expecting? Broad toilet humour? \nThe dark heart of the matter is the fractured relationship between soldier siblings Ray (Daniel \nDay-Lewis) and Jem Stoker (Sean Bean). Twenty years after tours of duty during the Troubles, \nRay survives off the grid in a forest (where Ocado definitely won’t deliver), living a life made up \nof solitude, the Shipping Forecast and tinkering with electronics. In his absence, the better-\nadjusted, religious Jem has become a husband to Ray’s ex Nessa (the ever-excellent Samantha \nMorton) and father to Ray’s twentysomething son Brian (Samuel Bottomley). \nAs they come together, the screenplay has the confidence to play early encounters without \ndialogue, perceptively revealing the strange, often silent bonds between brothers. Gradually and \nconvincingly, the pair begin to connect. Bean is subtle and superb as the quieter Jem, coaxing his \nsibling to open up, the story exploring the impact of fathers on sons, the limitations of faith, and \nhow violence only begets violence. \nIf it sounds talk-y and stage-bound, director Day-Lewis eschews kitchen-sink mundanity. While \nhe may OD on drone shots that make tree tops look like broccoli, he’s definitely one to watch. \nThere is visual poetry at play, be it in an evocative use of slow motion (dancing, fighting, \nsurprisingly similar), striking imagery (a stunning tracking shot through a countryside \nfairground) and a strand of Lynchian bonkersness that encompasses a freak hailstorm, a giant fish \nand, weirdest of all, a ghostly camel-like creature with a tiny dick. Mike Leigh, this is not. \nWhen the story cuts back and forth to the worried Nessa and troubled Brian, it feels a bit like \ntreading water until a fantastic dinner-table confrontation. But, unsurprisingly, the film is at its \nmost compelling when observing Ray. With tightly cropped grey hair, tats and a Bill The \nButcher-esque ’tache, Day-Lewis is by turns big and boisterous (marvel at him riffing on God’s \nunderpants, His testicles “swinging like church bells”), then small and shameful. Early on, he \nspins a stunning extended scatological tale that involves a priest and a Guinness-curry-laxative \ncombo that is simultaneously funny and horrifying. It instantly takes its place in the DDL \nMonologue Hall Of Fame: some of that unexpected broad toilet humour at its best. Welcome \nback, sir.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_961de905"}
