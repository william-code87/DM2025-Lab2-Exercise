So we call this spatial, spatial thing space. Or in time. So we call this spatial means space and for time. So they are in sequence of the transaction. So it's talking about which one is important in which transaction. And the genomic sequence data, you know, sequence data actually is also important. So, but then before we go through them very quickly because we don't talking about genomic sequence data. And the, uh, association, we're talking about sequence of transaction. Spatial and temporal data, we don't really cover them. And, uh, but if you want to know a little bit more about then go to the advanced data base course, we have the spatial temporal data.",
