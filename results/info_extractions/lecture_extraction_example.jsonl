It defines data sets as a collection of data organized in certain formats. It then categorizes data sets into two types: Structured Data Sets and Unstructured Data Sets. Structured data sets are described as organized in clear, predictable structures, often in rows and columns. Unstructured data sets are described as more complex and varied, usually derived from human-generated content like text, images, and videos.\n\n[TRANSCRIPT - 110:58]\nSo the next one we want to talking about the data set. We have different type of data set. You might heard about the term called structured data or unstructured data. Structured data is you know exactly the meaning about the row and column. Unstructured data is they will change. Sometimes you don't really know how to interpret them. Currently that the human generated content such as image, text, video, we consider them as unstructured data. Luckily with this AI thing and right now text, image, video already can be converting into structured format, but you still need to be able to know once we convert are they meaningful or not.\n\n[TRANSCRIPT - 111:58]\nSo we have different kind of characteristic about our data dimension we mentioned before. And then right here talking about another term called sparsity. Sparsity comes from a keyword called sparse. Sparse means very few. Like what we say that if you have the record in e-commerce store, like in Amazon. Your data is sparse in that data record. Because they have millions of the book. But then you probably only buy 10 books before. So make your data in the million of then become very sparse. So data are sparse. And then sometimes in certain place, we will also talking about the resolution. And that part about sparsity, how to solving them, how to do the resolution, we will talking about that later in some of the courses, some of them will be in classification, some of them will be in the text mining.\n\n[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]\nThe slide is titled \"Characteristics of Data Sets\". It lists three characteristics: Dimensionality, Sparsity, and Resolution. Under Sparsity, it notes \"Only presence counts\" and \"Patterns depend on the scale\". A speech bubble with \"Later\" is drawn next to Sparsity.\n\n[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]\nThe slide is titled \"Types of Data Sets\". It lists three types: Data Matrix, Document Data, and Transaction Data.\n\n[TRANSCRIPT - 112:58]\nSo we want to talk about different type of the data set. We have the data matrix, document data, transaction data. So data matrix look like this way. If your data can be convert into meaningful number, they can become data metric. Most of the data are in numerical attribute and then we allow them to do the ratio operation. To make sure all the value inside need to become the ratio data. If it's not, then right here they need to be ratio data.\n\n[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]\nThe slide is titled \"Data Matrix\". It states that a data matrix is applicable if each object has the same fixed set of numeric attributes. A table is shown with columns for 'Price', 'Sells', '# Reviews', and '# Readers', and rows for 'Book 1' through 'Book 5'.\n\n[TRANSCRIPT - 113:48]\nOkay. And the document data is a part that we were talking about later because before 2013, this is before 2013. And the people actually utilize document data in a vector form. Right here, they select important keyword in the document. And then after that, for every document, you utilize those important keyword, we got some number, occurrence of the number for that keyword right there. We generate a something called term vector. So each one of them are become vector. So why vector? Because in computer science, vector is the easiest way for us to operate. We convert them to vector. So in other word, every number right here are become ratio data.\n\n[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]\nThe slide is titled \"Document Data\". It explains that usually unstructured and textual, each document can be converted as a term vector. The value of each component is the number of times the corresponding term in the document appears. A table shows 'Document 1', 'Document 2', and 'Document 3' with columns representing terms like 'Learn', 'Teach', 'Data', 'Mining', 'AI', 'Python', 'R', 'Dataset'. The values in the table represent the count of each term in each document. A note indicates \"Before 2013\" with a handwritten \"B\" next to it. An arrow points to the table with the label \"Vector\" and \"Vector ratio\".\n\n[TRANSCRIPT - 114:44]\nBut that is way we try to working on that. Before 2013. After 2013, how we try to do that? We were talking about that that in the text mining part. So maybe three weeks later.\n", "document_id": "doc_ae5a228d"}
