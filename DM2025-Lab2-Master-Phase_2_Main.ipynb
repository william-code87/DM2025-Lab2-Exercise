      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",

      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

      "*   **Great performance on training data:** The model looks like a genius when you show it the data it already knows.\n",

      "\n",
      "A good student doesn't just memorize. They:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Understand the concepts:** They try to grasp the underlying principles.\n",
      "*   **Practice with variety:** They might look at different types of problems or ask their teacher for clarification.\n",
      "*   **Don't over-focus on tiny details:** They focus on the main ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, in machine learning, we use techniques to prevent overfitting, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Using more diverse training data:** Exposing the model to a wider range of examples.\n",
      "*   **Simplifying the model:** Making the model less complex so it can't memorize every detail.\n",
      "*   **Regularization:** Adding penalties to the model for being too complex.\n",
      "*   **Cross-validation:** A technique to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short:** Overfitting is when a machine learning model becomes too specialized in the data it was trained on, making it perform poorly on new, unseen data. It's like memorizing answers instead of learning the subject.\n",

      "### What is Overfitting?\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you are training a robot to recognize pictures of cats. You show it 1,000 photos from a single album to teach it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overfitting** is what happens when your robot learns this specific album of photos *too well*. It doesn't just learn that cats have fur, whiskers, and pointy ears. It starts memorizing the irrelevant details in your specific photos, like:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   \"The cat in photo #42 always sits on a red blanket.\"\n",

If the cat isn't on a red blanket or doesn't have that specific white spot, the robot might say, \"That's not a cat!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **Performance on Practice Test:** Perfect! They get 100%.\n",
      "*   **Performance on Real Exam:** Terrible. The real exam has new questions. The questions are about the same topics, but they are worded differently. Since the student only memorized the old answers and didn't learn the underlying concepts, they can't answer anything.\n",

      "This student uses the practice questions to understand the *concepts*. They learn *why* the events happened, who the key figures were, and how everything connects.\n",
      "*   **Performance on Practice Test:** Very good. Maybe not 100%, but they do well.\n",
      "*   **Performance on Real Exam:** Very good. Because they learned the general principles, they can apply their knowledge to answer new and unfamiliar questions on the same topics.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

This means that the entities it does find are likely to be correct and well-structured, but it may fail to identify all possible entities within the document.\\n1. Strengths (High Precision)\\nThe configuration has two major strengths that contribute to high-quality, accurate extractions:\\n- Clear, Constrained Prompt: The prompt is very specific, instructing the model to use exact text verbatim and defining a clear purpose for each class (opinion_statement vs. audience_impact) and attribute. This significantly reduces the chances of the model hallucinating or paraphrasing, ensuring the results are grounded in the source text.\\n- High-Quality Examples: The provided few-shot examples are excellent.

And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "Similarities\n",
    "1. Cluster Preservation: Both plots will likely show the same fundamental grouping of data. UMAP's strength is preserving local neighborhood structures, so distinct emotions like 'joy', 'anger', 'sadness', and 'fear' should form visible clusters in both 2D and 3D space.\n",
    "2. Relative Cluster Positions: The general relationship between clusters should remain consistent. For example, the negative emotions ('anger', 'sadness', 'fear') might group closer to each other, while the 'joy' cluster remains distant from them in both visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences\n",
    "1. Separation of Clusters: The most significant advantage of the 3D plot is its ability to reveal better separation between clusters. Two emotion clusters that appear to overlap or touch in the 2D projection might be clearly distinct when viewed with the added depth of a third dimension. You can rotate the 3D plot to find angles that show this separation clearly.\n",
    "2. Intra-Cluster Structure: The 3D view can reveal the internal \"shape\" and structure of each emotion cluster. What looks like a flat circle of points in 2D might actually be a more complex, spherical, or elongated cloud in 3D. This can provide insights into the diversity of language within a single emotion category.\n",
    "3. Interactivity and Exploration: While both plots are interactive, the 3D plot offers a richer exploration experience. The ability to rotate, pan, and zoom in a 3D space allows for a much deeper and more intuitive understanding of the high-dimensional relationships that UMAP has preserved. The 2D plot is limited to panning and zooming on a flat plane.\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Structure:**\n",
    "`System Instruction -> Task Description -> Examples (if not zero-shot) -> Text to Classify`\n",

    "- 0-shot vs. 1-shot: The jump from zero to one example only provided a very slight improvement. Accuracy increased by only 1.25%, and the macro average F1-score only rose by 0.02. This suggests that a single example was not enough to give the model strong guidance and may have even slightly confused it for some classes.\n",
    "- 1-shot vs. 5-shot: This is where the most significant leap occurred. Accuracy jumped by 7.5%, and the macro average F1-score increased sharply from 0.51 to 0.60. This improvement was consistent across all classes, indicating that the model finally had enough information to understand the nuances of each emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 0-Shot (Initial Guesswork): Without any examples, the model relies on its general, pre-trained knowledge. The results are unbalanced: it tends to over-predict 'joy' and 'anger' (high recall, low precision) while struggling to identify 'fear' and 'sadness' (low recall).\n",
    "2. 1-Shot (Unclear Guidance): The addition of a single example was insufficient. The minimal improvement suggests the lone example was either not representative enough or may have even slightly confused the model, as performance for 'sadness' decreased.\n",
    "3. 5-Shot (Strong Context): The significant jump to 60% accuracy shows that the model required a diversity of examples to build a robust understanding. With five examples, the model was able to learn:\n",
    "    - Linguistic Variation: It saw multiple ways each emotion could be expressed.\n",
    "    - Class Boundaries: It became much better at distinguishing between similar emotions, which improved both precision and recall across the board.\n",

    "**Case Study:** Check the results' files inside the `results/llm_classification_results` directory and find cases where the **text classification improves with more examples** (pred emotion is right with examples), **cases where it does not improve** (pred emotion always wrong) and **cases where the classification got worse with more examples** (pred emotion goes from right to wrong with examples). For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "The zero-shot model likely got confused by the social context (\"meet your best friend\") and misinterpreted \"crying\" as tears of joy, a common trope in stories. However, the explicit keyword \"scared\" is the true emotional signal here. After seeing five examples, the model learned to give more weight to direct emotional declarations. The few-shot examples for fear likely contained similar keywords (\"afraid,\" \"scared,\" \"worried\"), effectively teaching the model, \"When you see words like this, classify it as 'fear', regardless of the surrounding story.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not improve\n",
    "This is a classic \"garbage in, garbage out\" problem. The text snippet itself contains overwhelmingly positive and cozy language (\"fluffy blanket,\" \"dog is snoring,\" \"so ready\"). The true emotion, anger, is impossible to determine without the wider context of the conversation. The model makes a perfectly reasonable prediction (joy) based on the available text. No number of few-shot examples for anger can help here, because there are simply no words in the text that align with those examples. The model correctly identifies the sentiment of the snippet, but fails on the task because the necessary information is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Degradation\n",
    "The zero-shot model, using its broad, general knowledge, correctly identified that a \"frown\" is a common expression of anger. However, after seeing five examples, its prediction changed to fear. This suggests that the five examples provided for the anger class contained very strong and explicit keywords (e.g., \"rage,\" \"furious,\" \"hate,\" \"pissed\").\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
